# Password Manager

A simple password management software built for fun in Rust using SQLite for the database.
Both usernames and passwords are encrypted and hashed.

The system supports basic CRUD operations.  Other features such as MFA and toolchain support may come later. (Maybe even a real UI!)

Example output:
```
Password Manager:
1. Add an account
2. List accounts
3. Retrieve an account
4. Update an account
5. Delete an account
6. Change master password
x. Exit
Please choose an option:
