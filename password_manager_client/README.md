# Password Manger Client

This code is currently non-functional, and is in the process of being updated.

The plan is to create a browser-based frontend that will communicate with the server, most likely with ReactJS


## TODO
* [ ] Work out implementation details
    * [ ] Learn how to use IndexedDB
    * [ ] Handle encryption/decryption client side
        * The server should never see the master password
* [ ] Design frontend
* [ ] Integrate with server

This code is a work in progress
